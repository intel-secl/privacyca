# Intel<sup>Â®</sup> Security Libraries for Data Center  - Privacy CA
### This project provides an implementation of privacy certificate authority that is managed by the verification service. Each of the registered hosts for attestation provide the TPM measurements signed by the host's TPM generated Attestation Identity Key (AIK). The Privacy CA key is used as part of the certificate chain for the host AIK during Trust Agent provisioning and registration to the verification service.
