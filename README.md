# Intel<sup>Â®</sup> Security Libraries for Data Center  - Privacy CA
#### This project provides an implementation of privacy certificate authority that is managed by the verification service. Each of the registered hosts for attestation provide the TPM measurements signed by the host's TPM generated Attestation Identity Key (AIK). The Privacy CA key is used as part of the certificate chain for the host AIK during Trust Agent provisioning and registration to the verification service.

## Key features
- Provides implementation of `Privacy CA` which can be utilized to certify keys

## System Requirements
- RHEL 7.5/7.6
- Epel 7 Repo
- Proxy settings if applicable

## Software requirements
- git
- maven (v3.3.1)
- ant (v1.9.10 or more)

 - Use [Automated Build Steps](https://01.org/intel-secl/documentation/build-installation-scripts) to build all repositories in one go, this will also provide provision to install prerequisites and would handle order and version of dependent repositories.

***Note:** Automated script would install a specific version of the build tools, which might be different than the one you are currently using*
